# Donate to Almost Home Wyoming and help our cause

Almost Home Wyoming, a compassionate and dedicated non-profit organization in the heart of Lander, Wyoming, is on a mission to make a real difference in the lives of those who are experiencing homelessness or the threat of it.

Our heartfelt commitment is to ensure that everyone has access to safe and secure housing. We understand the challenges that individuals and families face when they find themselves without a place to call home.

We take pride in offering a helping hand by assisting our clients with deposits and rent, pending the Board's approval of their application. We firmly believe that everyone deserves to have a roof over their head, to feel safe, and to have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.

Help out the local Lander community today by donating to our cause. If you have any questions, or want to help out more, please [contact us](/contact "contact us").
