Almost Home Wyoming would like to thank the [LOR Foundation](https://lorfoundation.org/) and [Ami Vincent](https://lorfoundation.org/people/ami-vincent/) for the very generous grant money we recently received to ease the burden of homelessness in Lander! We are humbled by your commitment to make our community a better place for all!
